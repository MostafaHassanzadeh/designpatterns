Gateway pattern
===============

### Overview

Provides a simple uniform view of external resources to the internals
of an application.

Examples of external resources:

- Relational or NoSQL databases
- Web services like Google's or Yahoo's ones
- Filesystem of the server
- Other web and non-web applications for data interoperability

In other words, Gateway pattern allows programmer to encapsulate
platform-dependent code in single class.

### Reasons to use

If the answer to following questions is "yes", then most likely you should use
this pattern:

- Is there any persistence in your application (database, remote service,
  filesystem, etc.)?
- Are you going to introduce multiple types of persistence?
- Do you want to keep your business logic be independent on which type of
  persistence is used?
