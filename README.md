Programming Design Patterns
===========================

Repository with community-driven docs and examples for Programming Design
Patterns

Our mission

We tend to build the most full and up-to-date collection of good quality
examples and recommendations on use for all known Programming Design Patterns

Collaborating
-------------

To start collaborating:

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, apply your work,
  push the branch to Github, and send a pull request; or,

- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github

Using examples
--------------

### PHP

We're using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to resolve dependencies for our
PHP examples and tests. 
To run example called `something` in `state` pattern, change directory to
`state/php`, make sure to install all dependencies:

```
composer install
```

and execute test suit:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/something_test.php
```

This will execute test the suit agains an example found in
`state/php/examples/something.php`
