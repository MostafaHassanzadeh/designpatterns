# Programming Design Patterns [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/designpatterns/designpatterns.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/designpatterns/designpatterns)

Repository with community-driven docs and examples for Programming Design
Patterns

## Our mission

We tend to build the most full and up-to-date collection of good quality
examples and recommendations on use for all known Programming Design Patterns

## Collaborating

To start collaborating:

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, apply your work,
  push the branch to Github, and send a pull request; or,

- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github

## Using examples

### PHP

Our PHP examples were tested against PHP v5.4

We're using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to resolve dependencies for our
PHP examples and tests.

Every PHP example contains `%EXAMPLE_NAME%_usage.php` and `%EXAMPLE_NAME%_test.php`
files besides `%EXAMPLE_NAME%.php` file which contains the actual pattern code.

Here is how I would run an example, say called `car`, in `state` pattern:

```
cd state/php/example_car
php car_usage.php
```

..and here is how I would run it's test suit:

  - Install composer dependencies:

    ```
    cd state/php
    composer install
    ```

  - Run test suit:

    ```
    cd example_car
    ../vendor/bin/phpunit car_test.php
    ```
