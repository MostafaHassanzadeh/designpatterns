# Programming Design Patterns [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/designpatterns/designpatterns.png)](http://travis-ci.org/designpatterns/designpatterns)

Repository with community-driven docs and examples for Programming Design
Patterns

## Our mission

We tend to build the most full and up-to-date collection of good quality
examples and recommendations on use for all known Programming Design Patterns

## Collaborating

To start collaborating:

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, apply your work,
  push the branch to Github, and send a pull request; or,

- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github

## Using examples

### PHP

Our PHP examples were tested against PHP v5.4. We're using
[PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de) (v3.17.13 and above) to write and run test suites.

Every regular PHP example should contain following files (unless specified
otherwise in `README` file):

- `%EXAMPLE_NAME%.php` - actual pattern code
- `%EXAMPLE_NAME%_test.php` - test suit for pattern code
- `%EXAMPLE_NAME%_usage.php` - practical use example of pattern code

Here is how I would run an example, say called `car`, in `state` pattern:

```
php state/php/example_car/car_usage.php
```

..and here is how I would run it's test suit:

```
phpunit state/php/example_car/car_test.php
```

If you don't have **PHPUnit** installed, you can use
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to install it right inside the project:

```
composer install
```

This will create `vendor` directory with all dependencies. Running a test suite
then can be done via:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit state/php/example_car/car_test.php
```
