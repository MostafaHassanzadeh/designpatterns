Decorator pattern
=================

### Overview

One of multiple ways to add functionality to already existing classes

### Reasons to use

If the answer to following questions is "yes", then most likely you should use
this pattern:

- Am I working with existing code?
- Is there functionality that is to be added to an existing class?
- Am I sure that there is no safe way to add this functionality right into the
  class?
