Monostate pattern
=================

### Overview
The Monostate pattern is another way to achieve singularity. It works through a completely different mechanism.

### Reasons to use
 - Transparency - who ever use it, wont know its a singleton, and uses it as a regular object
 - Polymorphism - since the methods are not static inherit them and offer different behavior over the same properties.
